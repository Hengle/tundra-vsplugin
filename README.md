Visual Studio 2012 addin for Tundra 2.0
=============================================================================

Tundra is a high-performance code build system designed to give the best
possible incremental build times even for very large software projects.

This addin supports the "Compile current file" action in Visual Studio projects
generated by Tundra. Normally Visual Studio cannot build individual source
files in a NMake project as it doesn't run any commands itself.

A prebuilt [installer](http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tundra2-vsaddin/TundraVS2012.msi) is available (from commit d4702a3241851c389ecb2e2ff41ff3ab8ef33714).
